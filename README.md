An simple website to convert your screenshots using OpenCV and Tesseract, with the goal:
> Making your contact list building process more efficient

This can now be done via image-to-text conversion or text-to-text conversion. So you can screenshot your webpage or ctrl + A and crtl + V it inside this website. Click the convert button to convert your data to a usefull contact list containing all necessery information.

### In the future:
I want to make the image-to-text conversion faster and more consistent, by doing:
1. Improved image filtering => better window selection
2. More precise mask dimensions
3. Running image-to-text conversion when image is pasted => store data somewhere hidden
4. When convert button is hit only the remaining, not yet converted, images are converted to text
5. Remove more bugs
6. When images are deleted all corresponding data needs to be deleted => saved text data i.e.
